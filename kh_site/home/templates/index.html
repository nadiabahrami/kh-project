Itâ€™s for those of you seeking counseling, coaching, and/or resources to transform the limiting beliefs created by trauma that do not serve your ideal self.

My social justice counseling orientation not only will help you heal from trauma but also decreases the likelihood of re-traumatization that is often a reality for many survivors.</p>
