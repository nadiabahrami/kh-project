  <p>First off, congrats! Taking the time to research therapists means you're acting on your desires to make positive changes and that's something to be proud of.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Getting Past Survivor Mode and into Thriving Mode</h4>
  <p>Survivor mode, although once necessary to endure traumatic experiences, only paints the world in less vibrant colors. It holds us hostage to a limited range of experiences and feelings in order to remain safe. My hope for you is that in our time together we not only explore, and unpack the past but that we also move into painting the world with whatever colors you desire.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>A Unique Approach</h4>
  <p>The clinical theories I use are Narrative Therapy and Cognitive Processing Therapy. They are two of the most holistic methods of healing that I can offer you. Narrative therapy focuses on uncovering the stories we create about ourselves and the power to rewrite the destructive ones. Cognitive Processing Therapy offers concrete techniques to change maladaptive beliefs, thoughts actions and assumptions that get in the way of living the highest quality of life possible.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Making Lasting Changes</h4>
  <p>We all exists within various systems. Some systems are by nature oppressive and become secretly detrimental to our mental health. During our sessions we will explore the systems you belong to and uncover and revise the beliefs that you had to align with in order to safely navigate these dysfunctional systems. This means that if you had to believe that in order to be safe you must give away your power, or, that having extreme control over yourself and others means you can avoid getting hurt then you understand the power of our environment to shape who we are.</p>
  <p>This social justice perspective to counseling not only creates healing but also decreases the likelihood of finding yourself in future abusive-like environments. This strength based approach to therapy helps you to create a life where you are not a victim to your emotions and experiences but instead a powerful force for positive change and acceptance.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
