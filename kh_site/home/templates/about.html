    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I am a Licensed Mental Health Counselor Associate (# MC 60507339) based out of Seattle Washington. I actively seek to improve the quality of life of all those I cross paths with and to that end I offer individual and group therapy services, consultation for therapists and anti-oppression services. The main objective in all these services is empowerment.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p>My clinical specializations include helping survivors of traumatic experiences, those who live with PTSD, Anxiety, Depression, as well as survivors of Domestic Violence, sexual assault, and counselors in training.</p>
   <p>I am a group facilitator and some of my past group topics include: unpacking the effects of gender based violence, processing grief, maintaining sobriety, building emotion regulation skills, figuring out life career goals and discussing race, privilege and oppression.  I graduated with honors with my Master’s Degree in <a class="nonblock" href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/school-of-education/programs/graduate/counseling/copy2_of_course-of-study">Mental Health Counseling from CUNY Hunter College,</a> and did my undergraduate work in <a class="nonblock" href="http://sb.cc.stonybrook.edu/bulletin/current/academicprograms/psy/degreesandrequirements.php">Psychology</a> and Sociology at <a class="nonblock" href="http://sb.cc.stonybrook.edu/bulletin/current/academicprograms/soc/degreesandrequirements.php">Stony Brook University</a>.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p>I have worked in the mental health field at several outpatient treatment centers for those with chemical dependency issues and trauma. In 2012 I was licensed by New York State Department of Health (DOH) as a Rape Crisis Emergency Room Counselor. As of 2014, I received the training for Washington State requirements for a Domestic Violence direct service provider (WAC 388-61A-0350). I also worked at the YWCA Domestic Violence Emergency Shelter where I assisted women fleeing from abusive environments. In addition, I served as a mental health counselor at Seattle Therapy Alliance, a low-income clinic for women in Seattle where I treated women who suffer from PTSD, mood disorders, and traumatic stress.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p>My anti-oppression services include creating and facilitating the group “Having the Conversation: Discussing Race, Oppression and Privilege”. For almost a year, this group served participants as they navigated past and recent racism that is at the forefront of American consciousness.</p>
   <p>It’s important to mention that in all my work I acknowledge the oppressive systems that are responsible for the negativity that motivates people to come into therapy in the first place. These systems include race, class, gender, and sexual orientation. Exploring both the positive and negative patterns of these systems it is becomes clearer that they often give rise to sexual violence, domestic violence, and other forms of abusive environments.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p>Using Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and Narrative Therapy I seek to help clients uncover and revise the beliefs that they had to align with in order to safely navigate these oppressive systems.This social justice perspective not only helps clients heal from their trauma but also allows them to decrease the likelihood of re-victimization/re-traumatization that is often a reality for many survivors.</p>
