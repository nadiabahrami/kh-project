    <p id="about-p">I facilitate healing in individuals and groups affected by personal and collective trauma (including other healers). The support that I give, avoids pathology, and instead identifies the impact that oppressive systems have had on individual’s mental health and beliefs. These systems include: race, class, gender, family legacies, sexual orientation, etc. Combined with personal experiences, and trauma, these systems create limiting beliefs that create an unfulfilling life.</p>
    <p>I work tirelessly to assist clients in identifying/revising the beliefs that they have been forced to align with in order to remain safe during trauma. Doing this ensures that they regain their power and create the lives that they <span>choose</span> to live. Empowerment and thriving are always the outcomes I fight for!</p>
    <p>As a clinician I understand the toll that working as a helping professional has on our overall quality of life. I recognize the need for learning in our professions. I created Healing the Healers to meet these needs, please click here to learn more about it.</p>

    <h2>My Clinical & Personal Values</h2>
    <h4>Self-Empowerment</h4><p>I believe that we all have the right to make our own choices and the power to control our own lives. Personal and collective trauma often robs us of this birthright, I seek to restore this.</p>
    <h4>Equality</h4><p>I operate from the basic assumption that we are equal collaborators. Experts in what we know and ignorant in what we do not. This framework establishes curiosity and partnership.</p>
    <h4>Transformation</h4><p>I work from the idea that true transformation begins with the quality of our beliefs. Transforming our beliefs to live more authenticity and abundantly is true freedom.</p>
    <h4>Social Justice</h4><p>My work challenges the emotional, mental, and psychological consequences of injustice in order to create social justice first internally then externally.</p>
    <h4>Thriving</h4><p>All of my services help my clients to pursue a life where thriving isn’t just a possibility but a regular expectation.</p>

    <p>I am a Licensed Mental Health Counselor (# MC 60507339) based out of Seattle Washington. I graduated with honors with my Master’s Degree in Mental Health Counseling from CUNY Hunter College and did my undergraduate work in Psychology and Sociology at Stony Brook University.</p>
    <p>I have worked in the mental health field at several outpatient treatment centers for those with chemical dependency issues and trauma. In 2012 I was licensed by New York State Department of Health (DOH) as a Rape Crisis Emergency Room Counselor. As of 2014, I received the training for Washington State requirements for a Domestic Violence direct service provider (WAC 388-61A-0350). I also worked at the YWCA Domestic Violence Emergency Shelter where I assisted women fleeing from abusive relationships. In addition to this I have served as a mental health counselor at Seattle Therapy Alliance, a low-income clinic for women in Seattle where I assisted women who suffer from trauma related symptoms such as PTSD, Anxiety and Depression.</p>

    <h2>Anti-Oppression Work</h2>
    <p>I am committed to creating and maintaining opportunities for social justice and combating oppression. Below is some of my past work and involvements.</p>
    <p>I have had extensive training from the organization Seattle Therapy Alliance in social justice counseling and various issues related to the intersection of class, gender, race, and sexual orientation, as well as their impact on mental health.</p>
    <p>My past anti-oppression services also include creating and facilitating the group “Having the Conversation: Discussing Race, Oppression and Privilege”. For almost a year, this free community group served participants as they navigated past and recent racism.</p>
    <p>I recently served as a guest facilitator at the University of Washington’s (UW) “Racial Justice Organizing and Caucus” where I assisted in facilitating the conversation around the white-supremacist, extra-judicial killings of black people by providing them a space to caucus with other students, further their analysis of the various systems of oppression that cultivate these transgressions, and connect them to opportunities to channel their pain into action that directly support their fellow students and Seattle’s communities of color.</p>
    <p>In 2015 I created and facilitated trainings at the Young Women Christian Association (YWCA) detailing the intersection of Racism and Domestic Violence.</p>
    <p>I have also provided psychosocial assessments to assist undocumented immigrants and their families.  I worked closely with the organization Puentes whose mission is to support migrant undocumented communities. A psychosocial evaluation is a powerful tool to assist in a fair legal representation for migrants applying for asylum or other status in the U.S.</p>
