    <p class="p-large">Helping professionals work tirelessly to repair the physical, emotional and mental health of others. This includes classic helping professions like case managers, psychologists, and social workers, but also applies to lawyers, doctors, home attendants and other professionals. These healers have a higher potential to experience vicarious trauma, burnout, and develop mental health issues.</p>
    <p>The mission of Healing the Healers is to assist those in the helping professions to improve their overall quality of life using workshops, and talks. Also as a Trauma Stewardship coach I have worked with organizations such as Powerful Voices and the Young Womenâ€™s Christian Organization (YWCA).</p>
    <p>My work as a trauma stewardship coach and speaker allow me to help healers:</p>
