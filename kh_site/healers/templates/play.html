  <p class="col-md-10 col-sm-offset-1">As adults we tend to leave the playing to kids. Yet, after studying and surveying helping professionals in the community it appears that we need to learn a thing or two from the little ones.</p>
  <p class="col-md-10 col-sm-offset-1">Healing the Healers works to support the average helping professional in identifying, engaging in, and developing a practice of play! Kyeisha Hodge, the founder of Healing the Healers, can attest to this and demands time in her day few times a week to play. As a dancer, a movie enthusiast, and performer arts supporter, she finds a way to fill her weeks with fun and non-therapy speak. </p>
