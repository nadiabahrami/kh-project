    <h3 class="text-center">Who is the Group For?</h3>
    <p class="top-20">This group is for powerful, ambitious women who have been affected by domestic violence (childhood/family and adult/romantic forms) and have healed enough to live productive lives but still feel something is missing.</p>
    <p>These women are committed to their personal development and are searching for tools and strategies to design their lives to take things to the next level.</p>
    <p>They are tired of negative relationships, emotional breakdowns, aimlessness, intense fear, and self-doubt creeping into their lives. </p>
    <p>This group is for women who are willing to risk the discomfort and vulnerability associated with <strong>REAL transformation</strong> and are ready to step into their greatness.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Outcomes and Benefits</h3>
    <p class="top-20">The major undertaking of this group is to offer support, tools and encouragement so that members can: foster self-love, design a thriving life and eliminate the lies from domestic violence that have been internalized.</p>
    <p>Each group session will explore a theme associated with the above goals, provide check-in space for members, and flexibility to go with the group's flow.</p>
    <p>Each member will be asked to be vocal, to be fully present, and to both share and take up space.</p>
